    "Online shopping is a popular alternative to visiting physical retailers. Customers can browse, buy and receive products wherever they want. One common type of online vendors are clothing stores. Unlike physical stores where space is a constraint, online stores allow for all available items to be displayed to the customer. Customers can also quickly find the product they have in mind using the search function of the store website.\n",
    "\n",
    "To easily manage customer orders, the database should be able to relate customers to the products they bought, which is a fitting job for an RDBMS system. An RDBMS system also allows for fast queries of products, search filtering and grouping of products into multiple categories, giving the customer a better shopping experience."

Customers also have login details consisting of a username and a password, as well as a name and date of birth if they choose to sign up for an account.\n",
    "\n",
    "To draw customers, the store sometimes gives out exclusive **discounts**, each with a code, start date, end date, and amount of discount.A customer cannot have two discounts with the same code, but multiple customerscan have the same discount code. Not all have discounts, but all discounts must have a customer as the owner.\n",

Each product has a unique product ID, a name, number of items in stock, type (shirts, pants, etc), size, price, colors, categories it belongs to (men, women, accessories)<span style=\"background-color:#ffff00\"> and the link to its photo.</span> A product can be of multiple colors and belong to multiple categories. Note that similar products with different sizes are considered 2 separate products.

The date at which a product is made and given to the store is stored.\n",

Products can be added to orders with a specified quantity, i.e how many Blue Plaid Shirts are to be put in the cart. <span style=\"background-color:#ffff00\">When an order is made by a customer, it is shipped with a shipping cost and shipping status for tracking. The date at which the order is made is recorded.</span> The total price is derived from all the items bought and the delivery fee."
